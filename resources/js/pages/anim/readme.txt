v1: base port
v2: constant height & gap
v3: actual product data in each card  (note that the text content inside the card limits the amount of shinking - this was solved in my toy version)
v4: send in variants to each card
v5: choose the variant
  --Radio buttons wired up but the variant data is not used besides to highlight the radio button selected.
v6: ...scale item correctly...


TODO: 
v?: place item data in the cart (select variant and click 'add-to-cart')
