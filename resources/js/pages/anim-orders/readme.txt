v1: Ported base project (from: /Users/josh/dev/gsap-flip/smooth-filtering-react-TUI---WORKING-1D-FILTERING)
    and using data from orders table (joined on users table).
v2: Filtering on Dates and times (with calendar)
v3: Removed old filtering stuff and initialize calendar to correct date range


v3's initialization works but the animation filtering is broken.

TODO:
  -Port v3's initialization into v2
